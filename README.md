**Prediciton of wine quality** 

In this project i have used Kaggle dataset for wine quality prediction using various Machine learning models techniques we can predict whether the wine is in "Good Quality " or "Bad quality". In the kaggle we have the quality of wine between "1-10" , For the purpose of this project, I converted the output to a binary output where each wine is either “good quality” (a score of 7 or higher) or not (a score below 7). The quality of a wine is determined by 11 input variables

**Objectives**

The main objective of this project is to use various Classification methods to find the highest accuracy of predciting the quality of wine
